	A young girl walks through a secret door in her new home and discovers an alternate version of her life. 
	On the surface, this parallel reality is eerily similar to her real life - only much better. 
	But when her adventure turns dangerous, and her counterfeit parents (including Other Mother) try to keep her forever, 
	Coraline must count on her resourcefulness, determination, and bravery to get back home - and save her family.

	Set back in the late 1800s in a Victorian village, a man and woman by the names of Victor Van Dort and Victoria Everglot are 
	betrothed because the Everglots need the money or else they'll be living on the streets and the Van Dorts want to be high in society. 
	But when things go wrong at the wedding rehearsal, Victor goes into the woods to practice his vows. Just as soon as he gets them right, 
	he finds himself married to Emily, the corpse bride. While Victoria waits on the other side, there's a rich newcomer 
	that may take Victor's place. So two brides, one groom, who will Victor pick?

	In the town of Blithe Hollow, Norman Babcock is a boy who can speak to the dead, but no one besides his eccentric new friend, Neil, believes his ability is real.
	One day, Norman's estranged eccentric uncle tells him of an important annual ritual he must take up to protect the town from a curse cast by a witch it condemned centuries ago.
	Eventually, Norman decides to cooperate, but things don't go according to plan. Now, a magic storm of the witch threatens Blithe Hollow as the accursed dead rise. 
	Together with unexpected new companions, Norman struggles to save his town, only to discover the horrific truth of the curse.
	With that insight, Norman must resolve the crisis for good as only he can.
